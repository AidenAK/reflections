How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	You can quickly spot the error right away.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can go back to any stage easily if i need to.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The good thing about manual is commits are saved in thier logical stages. The bad thing is if you forget to save or if the computer crash, all data will be lost. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because the files are hightly related and dependent on each other to function properly.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to check the commits and git diff to compare the commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I still have the old code which is working.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    compare commits and files
