When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To collaborate with other developers. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Becasue automatic pulling can override the local repository with the old files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks is to clone a repository in GitHub only. 
    Clones can be used to clone a repository locally or from GitHub.
    Branches can be used to branch a local repository or a repository in GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can review the changes starting from the last known state before merging into the local branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Keep a record of all the changes using MS Word or something similar and share it with collaboraters. It will be tedious. Git or GitHub is a must have tool to collanorate with other developers. Even if you are not collaborating, you must have it for tracking the changes.   

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You want to make changes in a separate branch if you want to try out new ideas. The benefits of branching is changes that you make won't effect the main branch until it is approved to merge into the main branch. However, there might be a merge conflit that needs to resolve manually.
